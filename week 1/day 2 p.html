    <h1>The Joy of Learning</h1>
    <h3> Made by Lian Canlas</h2>
    <p> Learning new things opens the door to <b>endless opportunities</b>. It helps me <u>grow, adapt, and discover</u> my hidden talents.
    Everytime I try something <b>new</b>, I gain <strong>confidence</strong> and <strong>knowledge</strong>. Learning might be <em>challenging</em>, but i believe that it was always <u>worth it</u>.
    I might be afraid sometimes but <mark>exploring and stepping out of my comfort zone</mark> will be the first step towards growth and self-improvement. 
     I believe that growth begins when learning never stops. It’s just the <b>beginning of learning</b> more about <mark>myself, embracing new experiences, and gaining the courage</mark> to face challenges that help me grow.</p>
