                <h3>Leonardo da Vinci</h3>

                <p>
                   Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) was an Italian Renaissance artist, inventor, scientist, and engineer. 
                   He was known for studying anatomy, light, nature, and motion, which made his artworks incredibly realistic. 
                   His notebooks were filled with drawings of flying machines, human anatomy, architectural plans, and weapon designs. Aside from the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, he also created works like Vitruvian Man, which shows perfect human proportions.

                <h3>Vincent van Gogh</h3>
                 <p>
                    Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter known for his expressive brushstrokes and emotional use of color. 
                    Although he struggled with mental health and sold very few paintings during his life, he later became one of the most influential artists in history.
                     His unique style can be seen in works like The Starry Night, Wheatfield with Crows, and The Bedroom. Van Gogh painted over 2,000 artworks, most of them created in just the last 10 years of his life.

                <p>
                    Van Gogh's legacy lies in his ability to convey deep emotion through vivid colors and dynamic compositions. 
                    His work paved the way for modern art movements like Expressionism and Fauvism, influencing countless artists worldwide.
